/************THEME CONFIG************/


/***INITIAL

1. Install WordPress

2. Upload Wordousel Lite to your theme directory

3. Login to WP Admin Panel and enable theme



/***STATIC HOME***/

1. Once logged in go to Settings>Reading and enable static home

2. Front Page = Home | Post Page = Blog



/***Permalinks***/

1. Go to Settings>Permalinks and use Custom Structure= /%postname%/
	(This requires .htaccess permissions to do. It is not required for everything to work, just a recommendation)


	
/***CAROUSEL***/

1. Create new category ( I use Featured ). Once created get category theme ID by rolling over the category name on the categories page

2. open home_template and navigate to carousel area. It has been commented. find code <?php query_posts('showposts=4&cat=5'); ?> and replace cat=withyourcategoryID

3. Please read the rest of the comments on home_template, it explains the basics to getting the carousel working

4. Create a new post and ensure it is added to the category you created.

5. In the post create a new custom field naming it Thumbs and add the url to an image. Make sure the image is 413px ï¿½ 212px

6. Save and Publish post. It should now appear in the carousel

7. Repeat this for as many posts as you define in the carousel
