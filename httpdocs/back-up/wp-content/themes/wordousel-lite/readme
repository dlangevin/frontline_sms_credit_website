INITIAL

1. Install WordPress

2. Upload Wordousel Lite to your theme directory

3. Login to WP Admin Panel and enable theme


STATIC HOME

1. Once logged in go to Settings>Reading and enable static home

2. Front Page = Home | Post Page = Blog


Permalinks

1. Go to Settings>Permalinks and use Custom Structure= /%postname%/
	(This requires .htaccess permissions to do. It is not required for everything to work, just a recommendation)


CAROUSEL

1. Create new category ( I use Featured ). Once created get category theme ID by rolling over the category name on the categories page

2. open home_template and navigate to carousel area. It has been commented. find code <?php query_posts('showposts=4&cat=5'); ?> and replace cat=withyourcategoryID

3. Please read the rest of the comments on home_template, it explains the basics to getting the carousel working

4. Create a new post and ensure it is added to the category you created.

5. In the post create a new custom field naming it Thumbs and add the url to an image. Make sure the image is 413px ï¿½ 212px

6. Save and Publish post. It should now appear in the carousel

7. Repeat this for as many posts as you define in the carousel


NESTED COMMENTS

1. This theme includes nested comments capability. Ensure to try it out by turning this on in wp-admin / Settings / Discussions
